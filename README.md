## How It Works

The extension uses several techniques to bypass paywalls:

### 1. User Agent Spoofing
- Presents itself as Google's web crawler (Googlebot)
- Many sites allow free access to search engine crawlers

### 2. Cookie Clearing
- Removes tracking cookies that count article views
- Resets "free article" counters on metered paywalls

### 3. Referer Manipulation
- Makes requests appear to come from Google or social media
- Some sites allow free access from these sources

### 4. JavaScript Blocking
- Blocks scripts that implement paywall functionality
- Prevents dynamic paywall overlays from loading

### 5. DOM Manipulation
- Removes paywall overlays and restrictions
- Unhides article content that may be hidden

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Manifest V3** - Uses the latest Chrome extension API
- **Service Worker** - Background script handles requests and storage
- **Content Scripts** - Injected into web pages to manipulate content
- **Storage API** - Saves settings and custom sites across browser sessions
